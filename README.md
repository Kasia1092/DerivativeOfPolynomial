# Polynomial Derivative Calculator
##Kalkulator pochodnej wielomianu

###Description
The Polynomial Derivative Calculator is a Java Swing application that allows users to calculate the derivative of a polynomial expression. Users can input polynomial coefficients and powers, and the application will compute the corresponding derivative.

###Project Evolution
Initially, the Polynomial Derivative Calculator was implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. However, as the project evolved, the functionality of the View and Controller classes was integrated into the JFrameForm Swing class. This simplification allowed for better cohesion and reduced complexity.
The controller and view class is now unused.
